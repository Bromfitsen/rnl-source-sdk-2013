        <b>History:</b><br>
		Prior to the D-Day invasion elements of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment dropped from the sky  over Normandy.  A key objective for the 505th was the small hamlet of La Fiere, primarily because of the strategic bridge crossing over the Merderet river.  On the morning of June 6th the paras encountered stiff resistance from Germans entrenched in the manor of La Fiere.  Lacking heavy weapons the Americans were kept in check most of the morning.  By mid day the allied forces had grouped for a massive assault, taking the manor and securing the bridge.  Upon regrouping the Germans started what would be a two day skirmish over control of the bridge.
