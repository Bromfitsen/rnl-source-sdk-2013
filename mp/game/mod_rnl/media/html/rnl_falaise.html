			<h3>Objectives:</h3>
			<p><b>Allies:</b> Advance and take the German positions throughout the area. Secure and destroy the marked destruction objectives to weaken the German presence.
			<br><b>Axis:</b> Defend against the Allied advance at all costs! The Radiohouse and the Trenches are vital positions, make sure they do not fall into enemy hands. Protect the 88mm guns from destruction.</p>
			<h3>The event:</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on one aspect of Operation Tractable, the battle for the Falaise Gap, in Normandy, France. The Allies must advance over the fields to attack the first Germans outposts.
			   It is vital to the war effort because these German troops are the last vestiges of the Axis forces keeping the Allied troops from crossing the River Seine. The Allied troops in this encounter represent just one
			   arm of a three pronged attack to encircle the German positions. If the Germans cannot hold their positions, Paris and the German border will be open for the Allied advance.<br />
